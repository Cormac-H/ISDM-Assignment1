### <div align='center'>Problem Definition</div>
#### Project Outline
This report proposes a preliminary design for the implementation of a in-house call management center (CMC) information system. The development of this system is in response to pre-existing flaws in the current phone operations of a major travel agency. These flaws include the suitability of employees matched with customers, waiting time of customers, and sales time provided by employees. Our proposed system intends to provide functionality to match customers with employers most similar to their needs and socio-cultural background. By matching employees with suitable customers, not only is customer satisfaction expected to increase, but wait and sales times will sharply decrease when a customer can be targetted on a personal level. The proposed system intends to take advantage of existing company tools including the customer *'Profiler Tool'*, inbound *'Automatic Call Distributor'*, and of course the existing database.
